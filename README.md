# 📖 Bootstrap-pair-programming <a name="about-project"></a>


This project is an example of Bootstrap pair programming, developed as part of the Microverse curriculum. The aim of the project is to experience the power of using a CSS framework like Bootstrap to quickly and efficiently create a new website from scratch.

In this project, we implemented the main tools and features of Bootstrap, such as predefined classes, components, grids, and responsiveness, to create a modern and professional web page. Additionally, we used Git and GitHub for version control and team collaboration.

This project is an excellent example of how using a CSS framework like Bootstrap can speed up the website development process and improve efficiency in team projects.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>


Bootstrap pair programming's tech stack included the use of the Bootstrap CSS framework to quickly and efficiently style the content of web pages. Bootstrap provided pre-defined classes and components for creating a responsive and visually appealing design. In addition to Bootstrap, we also used HTML and CSS to structure and further style the content, as well as Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. Before beginning to code, we used Figma, a user interface design tool, to create a visual representation of the web pages, allowing us to explore different design options and iterate on the layout and elements.
